# Workspace Directory Rules for punchbag-cube-testsuite

- Always run Go commands (build, test, tidy, vendor, etc.) for a module inside that module's directory (e.g., run multitool commands in multitool/, not the workspace root).
- Never run Go commands for a module from the workspace root unless explicitly instructed.
- When editing or testing a module, always use the correct working directory for that module.
- If a user specifies a module, all actions must be performed in that module's directory unless otherwise stated.
- Always check the current directory with `pwd` before running any Go command or script.
- If in doubt, ask for clarification before running commands in the wrong directory.

# (Add more rules below as needed)
- if in doubt, check the todos first, then ask what todo
